# My AI Journey Work
Hi!, I'd like to show a web & mobile app named **My AI Journey Work** that use Midjourney API endpoints (remix) for creating photorealistic AI art based on text prompts. The project was inspired by a project that [Gonzalo Pozzo](https://links.gonzalopozzo.com/) had done a few weeks ago using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and ReplicateAI. 

The idea is to integrate GoogleSheet to a framework (React or Flutter), and the first step starts by using an spreadsheet file on Google Drive where each soccer match event contains information about the match in columns: **date|Team 1|goals|Team 2|goals**. The file is  loaded by fetching a *.tsv file in the app and then used to create a new squad of players for the next event.<br/>
I built two version, one written with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and other with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The flutter version implementes the MVC architecture design pattern and [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for the state management.

The ReactJS version implements [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to handle routing and [ReactBootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) to syle the app.
