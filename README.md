# My AI Journey Work
Hi!, I'd like to show a web & mobile app named **My AI Journey Work** that use [ImagineAI] (https://www.imagine.art/) API endpoints for creating photorealistic AI art based on text prompts. The project was inspired by a project that [Gonzalo Pozzo](https://links.gonzalopozzo.com/) had done a few weeks ago using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and ReplicateAI. 

The idea is to integrate AI image generato to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and create any image starting by using  images as part of a prompt (text) to influence a  composition, style, and colors. Text prompts are used with images prompts or  could be used alone. Once an image is generated,  it's stored on your [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account as a resource.

The flutter version implementes the MVC architecture design pattern and [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) for the state management.
